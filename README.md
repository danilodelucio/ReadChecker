<h1>Introduction 📓</h1>

This tool checks the versions of your Read nodes, coloring them to:

- **Green**: if they are updated;
- **Orange**: if they are out of date;
- **Red**: if they don’t exist;
- **Blue**: if they come from your Assets Library;

![Nodes color preview](https://github.com/danilodelucio/ReadChecker/assets/47226196/dccf07d3-7d93-415d-a690-8a8be01a992e)

This is helpful to check visually if the Read nodes are updated or not in your Node Graph.

<br>
<h1>Version Pattern ✅</h1>

The validation starts by looking for a version pattern in the file path of a Read node. This pattern is created using **Regular Expression**, so that any type of versioning (of the most used in the industry) is recognized. 
If the version captured doesn't match the pattern, the node will remain the default color.

<br>
<h1>Folders/Files validation 📁📄</h1>

Some examples of folders and files validation, if the version pattern is found:

- File name:

- Previous folder:

- Previous folder + File name

- Different folder + File name:

> [!WARNING]
> _Regardless of the file extension or if the folder is empty, **ReadChecker** will validate the version pattern found in the file path only._




<br>
<h1>Assets Library path 🔍</h1>

To set the color for the Assets Library, open the ReadChecker Settings panel and update the Assets Path.

> [!NOTE]
> _**ReadChecker** will not validate the versions for the Read nodes that contain the Assets Path, they will be only set to BLUE color._


<br>
<h1>Nuke and Python compatibility ☢️🐍</h1>

**ReadChecker** was written in **Python 2.7.16** and **3.10.5**, so it's designed to work with all versions of Nuke.




<br>
<h1>Performance 📊</h1>

By default, this tool utilizes the **updateUI()** callback, which means that all Read nodes will be validated after any changes to the script. Don't worry about performance issues, this callback is designed to run as a low-priority process. Additionally, it uses the **OnScriptLoad()** and **OnScriptSave()** callbacks to validate all Read nodes just once when the Nuke script is opened/saved.

If you prefer to not use the callbacks, you can run the tool whenever you want by using the **Validate now** button.

You can also turn on/off the callbacks by the ReadChecker Settings panel:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> _For now, the RED color for nodes with Error doesn’t work using the UpdateUI function._<br>
> _For more information about callbacks, please visit the [NUKE Python Developer’s Guide](https://learn.foundry.com/nuke/developers/latest/pythonreference/callbacks.htm) page._
